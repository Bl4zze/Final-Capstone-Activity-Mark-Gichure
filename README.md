# Penetration Testing Capstone Activity

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents a hands-on penetration testing capstone activity focused on identifying, exploiting, and remediating common web application and server vulnerabilities. The objective is to simulate a real-world penetration test and produce actionable findings for a client.

The assessment targets systems within the following network ranges:
- `10.5.5.0/24`
- `192.168.0.0/24`

---

## 🎯 Objectives / Expected Outcomes
By completing this activity, the following outcomes are expected:

- Perform reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery on web applications and servers
- Exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities to retrieve user credentials
- Crack password hashes using appropriate tools
- Gain authenticated access to a target system using compromised credentials
- Identify misconfigured web servers and accessible directories
- Locate challenge “flag” files stored on vulnerable systems
- Propose effective remediation techniques to mitigate identified vulnerabilities
- Document findings in a clear and professional manner

---

## 🧪 Challenges Completed

### Challenge 1: SQL Injection
- Identify vulnerable input fields
- Extract database information and user credentials
- Crack password hashes
- Access a remote system using compromised credentials
- Retrieve and analyze challenge files
- Recommend SQL injection remediation techniques

### Challenge 2: Web Server Vulnerabilities
- Conduct web server reconnaissance
- Identify directory listing and misconfiguration issues
- Access exposed directories via browser and URL manipulation
- Locate challenge files within vulnerable directories

## 🛠️ Tools Used
The following tools and technologies were used during this activity:

- **Kali Linux** – Penetration testing operating system
- **Web Browser (Firefox/Chrome)** – Manual testing and directory browsing
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** – Vulnerable web application for testing
- **SQL Injection Techniques** – Manual SQL payloads
- **Password Cracking Tools** (e.g. Hashcat / John the Ripper)
- **Reconnaissance Tools** (e.g. Nikto, directory enumeration techniques)
- **Linux Command Line Utilities** – File navigation and system access

---

## 📄 Deliverables
- Extracted credentials and cracked passwords
- Identified vulnerable directories and files
- Captured challenge codes (flags)
- Proposed remediation strategies
- This GitHub repository documenting the process
